You’ve entered the cave. It’s dangerous to go alone. You should probably take this sword.

An ogre stands in your way. It’s going to eat you if you don’t kill it first!

You have a sword and you manage to kill the ogre! Good job. Guess you’ll continue on your journey.

What a shame. If you had a sword you might’ve beaten him. If it’s any consolation, the ogre thinks you were delicious.

This room has glowing crystals hanging from the ceiling. For some reason you find that encouraging… Or at least it would be if they weren’t falling from the ceiling. You can only dodge them for so long…

Some goblins are in here shooting craps. They see you and demand that you join them. You see that you don’t have a choice.

One of the goblins says to you, ’I see you have some dice with you. Roll.’ You win your roll. The goblins laugh menacingly and start to surround you. When you ask why, they inform you that the wall in the previous room said, ’In the game of goblin craps, if you Win you will Die.’ Sucks to be you right now.
1
Upon seeing that you have no dice of your own, one of the goblins hands you his set. You lose and they all laugh, then wish you luck on finding your way out of this cave.

There are a dozen hounds asleep in here. They look vicious, even while sleeping. You try to tip-toe back into the previous room, but the door slams shut behind you! The noise wakes the hounds and they lay into you before you have time to think. Guess they were hungry.

You place the dynamite in front of the door you’d like to go through. It blows up and you can move on.

Nothing interesting in here… Save for the floor being covered in some liquid. It smells like gasoline.

The dynamite is about to explode. Even though you throw it across the room and would’ve been safe from the explosion, it ignites the gasoline on the floor and your life ends in excessive warmth.

You hope this gasoline doesn’t ruin your shoes…

Apparently that door was actually a portal into space. The expanse is beautiful, but you’re also frozen and dead. You spend your afterlife deciding whether or not that’s a reasonable trade.

There’s a man standing between you and the doors. He says he’s thirsty. So thirsty he could kill someone… He demands something to drink

You give him the potion. He thanks you for the drink and then says his fingers are tingling. They disappear and the rest of the man quickly follows suit. Guess you can leave this room now.

Upon saying you have nothing for him, the man replies, ’That’s a shame. I guess your blood will have to do.’

Looks like both doors lead to the outside. Now that you have this pot of gold, do you really need to go rescue that lady? You could probably live pretty well off this. Oh well, may as well finish what you started.

There’s a leprechaun in here. He says he lost his pot of gold.

He can see that you’re holding a pot of gold and demands to have it. It’s no skin off your back to give it to him, so you do. He jumps with glee and disappears in a puff of shamrocks. Onward!

The leprechaun sees that you don’t have a pot of gold with you and turns red with rage! Before you know it he’s jumped on you and is strangling you! Who knew leprechauns were so strong… You ponder this as you run out of air and your vision fades to black.
